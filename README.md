Modern capitalism is undergoing radical changes due to new social trends and blockchain development. We are living in the Post-Fordism era, where the labor is not alienated anymore, capital isn't fixed and means of production aren't necessarily owned by the bourgeoisie. So Karl Marx can rest in peace while our generation rethinking not only the Labor conditions and organization structures, but the Labor itself.

We #BUIDL KYODO new economy model for DAO with the hottest instrument of rewarding community participants.   
KYODO Dapp is for managing DAO based on Ethereum blockchain.

Many modern thinkers have noted new features of the Post labor era that we are experiencing nowadays.
The main long-term social trends should be taken into account modeling modern organization. 

### Main long-term social and economic trends
- Liquid modernity / Hyper fluidity / Constant changing / Avoiding long-term obligations / Nomadism <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>
- Third industrial revolution / Global switching from vertical hierarchy to horizontal organizations / Decentralization <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>
- Post labor <sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup> / Workless world <sup id="a4">[4](#f4)</sup>  / Labor Gamification <sup id="a5">[5](#f5)</sup> 
- Networks for collective individuation  <sup id="a6">[6](#f6)</sup>

"It is a kind of chaotic continuation of modernity, where a person can shift from one social position to another in a fluid manner. Nomadism becomes a general trait of the 'liquid modern' man as he flows through his own life like a tourist, changing places, jobs, spouses, values and sometimes more—such as political or sexual orientation—excluding himself from traditional networks of support, while also freeing himself from the restrictions or requirements those networks impose."

"Liquid modernity" Zigmund Bauman [↩](#a1)

"Jeremy Rifkin explores how Internet technology and renewable energy are merging to create a powerful new engine of economic growth. This process will usher in a fundamental reordering of human relationships, from hierarchical to lateral, that will impact the way we conduct commerce, govern society, educate our children, and engage in civic life."

"Labor becomes a voluntary activity there the working class owns the means of production. With this freedom, humans create with sincerity and desire, and not out of materialistic necessity."
"Play and labor" Chin Jungkwon 2017 "Superhumanity" [↩](#a3)

<b id="f4">4</b> 
“New revolution is moving us to the edge of workless world”
“the information and communication technology revolutions virtually guarantee more production with less human labor… Free time will come, William Green said, the only choice is unemployment or leisure.” 
Jeremy Rifkin “The End of Work: Decline of the Global Labor Force and the Dawn of the Post-Market Era” 1999 [↩](#a4)

<b id="f5">5</b> 
"According to Marx, capitalist is "alienated" labor. However, the situation is different now. As capitalism grew to become semiotic, aesthetic and play-like, the structure of human desire changed. Since the 1990s, wages have not been the only incentive for economic activity. That is, there has been an increasing amount of people who pursue what they are good at, even at the expense of high wages."
"Play and labor" Chin Jungkwon 2017 "Superhumanity" [↩](#a5)

The era of self-interested individuals, but they are looking for individuation through collective, through common activity and they will need networks for individuation.

"Each collective project could be defined by an agreed-upon goal, and requirements of fulfillment are collective initiated and updated by ‘members’ of the group.
Tasks can then be assigned either in the form of individual actions or subgroups. Groups can be merged together to form larger projects at any time, and a project can also be split into smaller collectives. 
In this manner, collectives can discover each other and communicate to seek possibilities of collaborations and information sharing.”

### Challenges KYODO meets

- Create a framework for liquid/sustainable/horizontal organizations, that could serve as a tool to manage its activity, be incentive and efficient. 
- Test the new reward mode for #DAO members activity, that matches the post labor era features (fun/work, no long-term obligations, follow self-interests)
- Achieve a network effect that brings mass adoption closer.

## Cryptoeconomy KYODO

### KYODO Impression revenue model
> Now that the commodity value of human labor is becoming increasingly tangential in an even more automated world, new ways of defining human worth and the social relationship will need to be explored
>
> -- *Jeremy Rifkin* "End of work"

We also think that "Pay per hour" or monthly salary better fit robots that produce countable units with a stable quality.
As a DAO we meet evaluation challenges: 
How the enthusiasm or dedication could be evaluated?
How the progressiveness or intuition could be estimated?
How the single time but relevant contribution could be rewarded?

KYODO came up with an Impression revenue model as a solution. An actor posts a link with a contribution he did. The community members evaluate every contribution with sending tips by points bot on coworking platform (Riot, for now, Github and Jitsi in progress).  The list of the done tasks will be added to the Ethereum blockchain.
The earned points for a period will be converted to DF tokens and sent to a member private wallet. 
That is the way how a member gets a share of the common fund, gets involved in the community development. 
The token value is based on the effectiveness of the activity of the members.
Actually, as it is asset-backed the price is based on the cap of the fund, but holders/members interests are aligned to increase the token price by increasing its cap. 
Every member of a community is interested to evaluate other contributors fairly to motivate them for further actions. Also, community members know the best if someone did a job well. 
More about DF token model read in Token economy paragraph. (link)




### Transaction costs
The productive processes and organization of labor fits within the KYODO framework that incorporates Blockchain, tokenization and collective intelligence and lead to lowering costs of coordination DAOs allow it to scale larger. Means KYODO reduces the transaction costs. Let's see which ones:

1. Costs of blockchain transactions
KYODO records to Ethereum blockchain the token allocation. To reduce the transaction cost of this operation. KYODO doesn't record every tip that each member receives, but collect the data of it on backend application with Mongo database cache layer. KYODO records the data to Ethereum blockchain one time in the end of period paying ETH for Gas.
Period*- conditional time interval while tips are collecting before being recalculated into tokens and sent to a members.

2. Bargaining costs 
They are the costs related to coming to an agreement that is agreeable to the parties involved and drawing up the contract. 
Aragon voting
permissionless system

3. Policing and enforcement costs
They are the costs associated with making sure that the parties in the contract keep up their word and do not default on the terms of the contract.

4. Search and information costs
They are the costs associated with looking for relevant information and meeting with agents with whom the transaction will take place.
KYODO motivates to share result to be rewarded.

5. Opportunistic behavior
